# h3-fight-sim-presentation

Development version. **Works only with python 3!**

Required modules: see `requirements.txt`. `Transcrypt` is only required to convert fight simulator to javascript. For that, and some other setup tasks, you also need to download submodule https://github.com/maciek16180/h3-fight-sim to `h3_fight_sim` directory if git doesn't do it automatically.

Run `python manage.py runserver` in the project directory and go to `localhost:8000/battles/` in your browser.
